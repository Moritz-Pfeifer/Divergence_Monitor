# Divergence Monitor

There are basically two scripts, one script calculates cycles and the other calculates divergences between the cycles. The setup of the website should be

1. one large graph showing the final divergence indicator

2. The 3d maps for each divergences (Business Cycle, Financial Cycle, Fiscal Cycle)

3. The Cycles themselves (ideally interactive, so that the user can choses type of cycles and countries and download the data as csv)

Use git action so that the website can be updated once the scripts are up-to-date


(We still need to modify the script to include the calculations for the fiscal cycle, but should be ok for you to start)
